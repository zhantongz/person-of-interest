person-of-interest
==================
This project in Java is to build a role-playing game for users over 14 years old based on skills learned in Computer Science 20. In this game, the user is a special agent working for a secret organization to ensure the world security. The user needs to act accordingly toward different targets/missions with his/her knowledge. The mission is determined by the person(s) of interest (POI). POI could be victim(s) or criminal(s). The user should target and monitor POI to prevent the crime(s). The organization has a rank from Constable to Commissioner, although the user can achieve Superintendent at the most. The user would move in the virtual world and solve puzzles and problems. There are missions that may cause the user's death in the virtual world, and, the user should not do things that kill him/her or the game is over. The objective for the user is to become an Inspector for a specic region and ensure the security for six months, then, the user becomes a Superintendent finishing the game. The game is designed to be over in less than four hours.
